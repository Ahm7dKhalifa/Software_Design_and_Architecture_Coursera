You've also learned how CRC cards can be used for prototyping and simulation. 
This allows you to reveal shortcomings in the requirements or design.
 Again, CRC cards are just a technique for representing candidate components, their responsibilities and connections.
 Using note cards won't guarantee a great speech and you still need to be experienced in speech writing to be able to arrange your talking points properly.
 Similarly, you still need to be knowledgeable of various design techniques in order to define your CRC cards and form your design properly.
 Throughout the rest of this specialization, we will discuss various techniques so you can design more effectively.
